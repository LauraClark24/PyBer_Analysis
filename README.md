# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis is to take the large amount of data provided and give simple summary and visual data to provide a better understanding of the differences between the various types of cities that the data describes.

## Results
One easy to see fact is that Rural cities have smaller numbers, less drivers, rides, and subsequently a smaller total of fares. This offset by the fact that having all the numbers smaller makes it possible for the Rural cities to have the largest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

With a little thought, it makes sense that a Rural city would be more spread out, requiring a larger fare per ride, as well as the considerably smaller numbers from the totals in cities that have a smaller population.

The Urban cities have a larger range for the number of rides per city and more than double the variability in range for number of drivers compared to Suburban cities. There does not seem to be any specific reasoning behind why some urban centers will have about 70 drivers while others will have only 5, a number more normal to see in a rural area. By looking closely at the scatter chart, we can see that some of these urban centers with so few drivers still manage to have just as many to more total rides than the cities that have so many more drivers. This indicates that, although this seems odd, it is not concerning and should not have a negative affect on the profits in any of the cities.

Given all the facts, there should be no surprise that our line chart does not have anything crossing or even touching. The interesting part is when the lines spike up, and understanding those trends may help predict when to be prepared for increased traffic on our network.

## Summary
After looking through the data, there are interesting fact to be observed and studied in more detail. The overview of average fares and drivers provided little insight, but looking into the average fare, perhaps even in tandem with the total number of rides, may give a better insight into busy times of the year and allow for planning to take the increased traffic on the network. From the current analysis, the end of February has one such increase in traffic, leaving potential for there to be many more throughout the year.
